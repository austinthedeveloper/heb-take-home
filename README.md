# HEB Take-Home: Pizza Order System

## Installation

- `npm install`
- `npm run start:ui`
- Open Browser to `localhost:4200`
- Log in with the credentials provided in the PDF

## Features

- Auth
  - Login
  - Auth Guard on all pages other than Login
  - Interceptor for adding the token on every call
  - NOTE: I am not storing this token in Storage. The token will disappear on refresh
- Monorepo
  - The main containers and components are located in a standard application
  - Other files that are normally shared live in their own library
  - ex. Interfaces, Services, Shared Components
- Routing
  - Orders has an example of a Resolver that checks the store before making an API call
  - All routes have Guards except for Login
- Store
  - This uses a very simple store I created, `Behavior Subject Entities`
  - This store is attached to the Orders Service by extending it
- Bootstrap
  - Used to speed up UI development
  - Sidebar, Login, and Form Inputs are all pulled from their examples
- CRUD
  - Creating, Copying, and Deleting all work by using the API
  - Update is faked since there is no endpoint for it in the Swagger docs. Any changes made to an item will be lost after refreshing
- Service Injection
  - Orders and Auth Service have examples of Injecting the application's environment file into a Library
- Pipes
  - A simple pipe was created to identify which orders are from today
  - NOTE: I noticed that the API timestamp seems off by a few hours. It might throw a newly created item in the "Past Orders" table
  - The function I created to identify today was grabbed from a tutorial. I credited the article above the function
- Orders Table Actions
  - Copy: This copies the selected item and removes the ID before saving
  - Edit: Modifies the selected item. Does not save to the API
  - Delete: Hits the API and removes it
- Logout
  - The User at the bottom left is a dropdown
  - Click it and click Logout
  - This clears the token and sends the user back to Login

## Design Note

I wanted to <strong>focus solely on the architecture and functionality</strong> of this application instead of the design. All of the pieces are ready for a designer to hand a design to the developer and they can easily make modifications.
